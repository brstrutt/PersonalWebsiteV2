A small website that shows a picture of the moon in its current phase (very rough calculation, do not use this website for accurate phase information).
It also includes a slider that lets you change the moon phase that is currently shown (this was added more for debug purposes so I could confirm the correct image is shown for each phase).

The site can be seen at [https://brstrutt.github.io/MoonPhase/](https://brstrutt.github.io/MoonPhase/)
